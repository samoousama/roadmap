            <strong>TERMS OF USE</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Unless otherwise specified, the terms of use detailed in this
            section apply generally when using Nata in Data.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            Single or additional conditions of use or access may apply in
            specific scenarios and in such cases are additionally indicated
            within this document.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            By using Nata in Data, Users confirm to meet the following
            requirements:
          </p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              There are no restrictions for Users in terms of being Consumers or
              Business Users;
            </li>
            <li>
              Users aren&apos;t located in a country that is subject to a U.S.
              Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S.
              Government as a “terrorist-supporting” country;
            </li>
            <li>
              Users aren&apos;t listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited
              or restricted parties;
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>Account registration</h3>
          <p>
            To use the Service Users must register or create a User account,
            providing all required data or information in a complete and
            truthful manner.
          </p>
          <p>Failure to do so will cause unavailability of the Service.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            Users are responsible for keeping their login credentials
            confidential and safe. For this reason, Users are also required to
            choose passwords that meet the highest standards of strength
            permitted by Nata in Data.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            By registering, Users agree to be fully responsible for all
            activities that occur under their username and password.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users are required to immediately and unambiguously inform the Owner
            via the contact details indicated in this document, if they think
            their personal information, including but not limited to User
            accounts, access credentials or personal data, have been violated,
            unduly disclosed or stolen.
          </p>
          <h3>Account termination</h3>
          <p>
            Users can terminate their account and stop using the Service at any
            time by doing the following:
          </p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              By using the tools provided for account termination on Nata in
              Data.
            </li>
            <li>
              By directly contacting the Owner at the contact details provided
              in this document.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            However, termination of the account will not be possible until the
            subscription period paid for by the User has expired. To the extent
            permitted by the applicable law, payments are non-refundable and we
            do not provide refunds or credits for any partial membership
            periods, unless otherwise agreed in written form.
          </p>
          <h3>Account suspension and deletion</h3>
          <p>
            The Owner reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to suspend or
            delete at any time and without notice, User accounts which it deems
            inappropriate, offensive or in violation of these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            The suspension or deletion of User accounts shall not entitle Users
            to any claims for compensation, damages or reimbursement.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            The suspension or deletion of accounts due to causes attributable to
            the User does not exempt the User from paying any applicable fees or
            prices.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h2>Content on Nata in Data</h2>

            or its licensors.

            provided on Nata in Data infringes no applicable legal provisions or
            third-party rights. However, it may not always be possible to
            achieve such a result.
          </p>
          <p>
            In such cases, without prejudice to any legal prerogatives of Users
            to enforce their rights, Users are kindly asked to preferably report
            related complaints using the contact details provided in this
            document.

          <p>

            so through the User or their device, even without the User&#x27;s

          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            Where explicitly stated on Nata in Data, the User may download, copy
            and/or share some content available through Nata in Data for its

            Through Nata in Data Users may have access to external resources
            provided by third parties. Users acknowledge and accept that the

          <p>

            Users are solely responsible for making sure that their use of Nata

          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            Therefore, the Owner reserves the right to take any appropriate
            measure to protect its legitimate interests including by denying
            Users access to Nata in Data or the Service, terminating contracts,
            reporting any misconduct performed through Nata in Data or the
            Service to the competent authorities – such as judicial or

          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            The characteristics of the chosen Services will be outlined during

          <h3>Purchasing process</h3>
          <p>
            Any steps taken from choosing a Service to order submission form
            part of the purchasing process.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>The purchasing process includes these steps:</p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              Users must choose the desired Services and verify their purchase
              selection.
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>Order submission</h3>
          <p>When the User submits an order, the following applies:</p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and
              therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price,
              taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the
              order page.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case the purchased Service requires active input from the User,
              such as the provision of personal information or data,
              specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an
              obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt
              confirming that the order has been received.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall
            be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order
            submission, about any fees, taxes and costs (including, if any,
            delivery costs) that they will be charged.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>Prices on Nata in Data are displayed:</p>

              costs, depending on the section the User is browsing.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>Offers and discounts</h3>
          <p>
            The Owner may offer discounts or provide special offers for the
            purchase of Services. Any such offer or discount shall always be
            subject to the eligibility criteria and the terms and conditions set
            out in the corresponding section of Nata in Data.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            Offers and discounts are always granted at the Owner&apos;s sole
            discretion.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            Repeated or recurring offers or discounts create no claim/title or
            right that Users may enforce in the future.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            Depending on the case, discounts or offers shall be valid for a
            limited time only or while stocks last. If an offer or discount is
            limited by time, the time indications refer to the time zone of the
            Owner, as indicated in the Owner&apos;s location details in this
            document, unless otherwise specified.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>Methods of payment</h3>
          <p>
            Information related to accepted payment methods are made available
            during the purchasing process.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional
            conditions or fees. In such cases related information can be found
            in the dedicated section of Nata in Data.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            All payments are independently processed through third-party
            services. Therefore, Nata in Data does not collect any payment
            information – such as credit card details – but only receives a
            notification once the payment has been successfully completed.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            If a payment through the available methods fails or is refused by
            the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation
            to fulfil the purchase order. Any possible costs or fees resulting
            from the failed or refused payment shall be borne by the User.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>Retention of usage rights</h3>
          <p>
            Users do not acquire any rights to use the purchased Service until
            the total purchase price is received by the Owner.
          </p>
          <h3>Contractual right of cancellation</h3>
          <p>
            The Owner grants Users a contractual right to cancel the purchase
            under the terms and conditions described in the relevant section of
            Nata in Data within 30 days of concluding the contract.

          <h3>Assignment of contract</h3>
          <p>
            The Owner reserves the right to transfer, assign, dispose of by
            novation, or subcontract any or all rights or obligations under
            these Terms, taking the User&apos;s legitimate interests into
            account. Provisions regarding changes of these Terms will apply
            accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>

          <h3>Severability</h3>
          <p>
            Should any provision of these Terms be deemed or become invalid or
            unenforceable under applicable law, the invalidity or
            unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of
            the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force and
            effect.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>US Users</h3>
          <p>
            Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted,
            construed and reformed to the extent reasonably required to render
            it valid, enforceable and consistent with its original intent. These
            Terms constitute the entire Agreement between Users and the Owner
            with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all other
            communications, including but not limited to all prior agreements,
            between the parties with respect to such subject matter. These Terms
            will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>EU Users</h3>
          <p>
            Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void, invalid or
            unenforceable, the parties shall do their best to find, in an
            amicable way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions
            thereby substituting the void, invalid or unenforceable parts.
          </p>
          <p>
            In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable
            provisions shall be replaced by the applicable statutory provisions,
            if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <p>
            Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the
            impossibility to enforce a particular provision of these Terms shall
            not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are
            essential to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties
            would not have entered into the contract if they had known that the
            provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining
            provisions would translate into an unacceptable hardship on any of
            the parties.

          <h3>Online dispute resolution for Consumers</h3>
          <p>
            The European Commission has established an online platform for
            alternative dispute resolutions that facilitates an out-of-court
            method for solving any dispute related to and stemming from online
            sale and service contracts.
          </p>
          <p>‍</p>

            resolving any dispute stemming from contracts which have been
            entered into online. The platform is available at the following
            link.
