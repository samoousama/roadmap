          </p>
          <p>
            Complete details on each type of Personal Data collected are
            provided in the dedicated sections of this privacy policy or by

          </p>
          <p>
            Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or, in case of
            Usage Data, collected automatically when using Nata in Data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by Nata in Data is
            mandatory and failure to provide this Data may make it impossible
            for Nata in Data to provide its services. In cases where Nata in
            Data specifically states that some Data is not mandatory, Users are
            free not to communicate this Data without consequences to the
            availability or the functioning of the Service.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are
            welcome to contact the Owner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any use of Cookies - or of other tracking tools - by Nata in Data or
            by the owners of third-party services used by Nata in Data serves
            the purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in
            addition to any other purposes described in the present document and

          <p>
            Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained,
            published or shared through Nata in Data and confirm that they have

          </p>
          <h2>Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>
          <h3>Methods of processing</h3>
          <p>
            The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent
            unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized
            destruction of the Data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled
            tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly
            related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some
            cases, the Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in
            charge, involved with the operation of Nata in Data (administration,
            sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties
            (such as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers,
            hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed,
            if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of
            these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.
            <br />
          </p>
          <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
          <p>
            The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the
            following applies:
            <br />
          </p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.
              Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed to process
              Personal Data until the User objects to such processing
              (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the
              following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the
              processing of Personal Data is subject to European data protection
              law;
            </li>
            <li>
              provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement
              with the User and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
            </li>
            <li>
              processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
              which the Owner is subject;
            </li>
            <li>
              processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public
              interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the
              Owner;
            </li>
            <li>
              processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
              interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
            </li>
            <li>
              In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific
              legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
              whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
              contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into
              a contract.
              <br />
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Place</h3>
          <p>
            The Data is processed at the Owner&#x27;s operating offices and in
            any other places where the parties involved in the processing are
            located.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Depending on the User&#x27;s location, data transfers may involve
            transferring the User&#x27;s Data to a country other than their own.
            To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred
            Data, Users can check the section containing details about the
            processing of Personal Data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data
            transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any
            international organization governed by public international law or
            set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the
            security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by
            checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with the
            Owner using the information provided in the contact section.
            <br />
          </p>
          <h3>Retention time</h3>
          <p>
            Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required
            by the purpose they have been collected for.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore:
            <br />
          </p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of
              a contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained until
              such contract has been fully performed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner&apos;s
              legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to
              fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information
              regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the
              relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period
            whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as long as
            such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged
            to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do
            so for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an
            authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
            Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to
            rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced
            after expiration of the retention period.
            <br />
          </p>
          <h2>The purposes of processing</h2>
          <p>

            its Users or third parties), detect any malicious or fraudulent

            in Data from within a unified platform. Such platforms provide a
            wide range of tools to the Owner - e.g. analytics, user
            registration, commenting, database management, e-commerce, payment
            processing - that imply the collection and handling of Personal
            Data.
          </p>

          <p>
            In particular, Users have the right to do the following:

          </p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              Object to processing of their Data. Users have the right to object
              to the processing of their Data if the processing is carried out
              on a legal basis other than consent. Further details are provided
              in the dedicated section below.
            </li>
            <li>
              Access their Data. Users have the right to learn if Data is being
              processed by the Owner, obtain disclosure regarding certain
              aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the Data undergoing
              processing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Verify and seek rectification. Users have the right to verify the

            </li>
            <li>
              Restrict the processing of their Data. Users have the right, under
              certain circumstances, to restrict the processing of their Data.
              In this case, the Owner will not process their Data for any
              purpose other than storing it.
            </li>

            How we collect information: what are the sources of the personal
            information we collect?
          </p>
          <p>
            We collect the above mentioned categories of personal information,
            either directly or indirectly, from you when you use Nata in Data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, you directly provide your personal information when you
            submit requests via any forms on Nata in Data. You also provide
            personal information indirectly when you navigate Nata in Data, as
            personal information about you is automatically observed and
            collected. Finally, we may collect your personal information from
            third parties that work with us in connection with the Service or
            with the functioning of Nata in Data and features thereof.

            How we use the information we collect: sharing and disclosing of
            your personal information with third parties for a business purpose
          </p>
          <p>
            We may disclose the personal information we collect about you to a
            third party for business purposes. In this case, we enter a written
            agreement with such third party that requires the recipient to both
            keep the personal information confidential and not use it for any
            purpose(s) other than those necessary for the performance of the
            agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also disclose your personal information to third parties when
            you explicitly ask or authorize us to do so, in order to provide you
            with our Service.

          <p>Sale of your personal information</p>
          <p>
            For our purposes, the word “sale” means any “selling, renting,
            releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring
            or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic
            means, a consumer&#x27;s personal information by the business to
            another business or a third party, for monetary or other valuable
            consideration”.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that, for example, a sale can happen whenever an
            application runs ads, or makes statistical analyses on the traffic
            or views, or simply because it uses tools such as social network
            plugins and the like.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>Your right to opt out of the sale of personal information</p>
          <p>
            You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal
            information. This means that whenever you request us to stop selling
            your data, we will abide by your request.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such requests can be made freely, at any time, without submitting
            any verifiable request, simply by following the instructions below.

          <p>Instructions to opt out of the sale of personal information</p>
          <p>
            If you&apos;d like to know more, or exercise your right to opt out
            in regard to all the sales carried out by Nata in Data, both online
            and offline, you can contact us for further information using the

          <p>
            We may use your personal information to allow the operational
            functioning of Nata in Data and features thereof (“business
            purposes”). In such cases, your personal information will be
            processed in a fashion necessary and proportionate to the business
            purpose for which it was collected, and strictly within the limits
            of compatible operational purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also use your personal information for other reasons such as
            for commercial purposes (as indicated within the section “Detailed
            information on the processing of Personal Data” within this
            document), as well as for complying with the law and defending our
            rights before the competent authorities where our rights and
            interests are threatened or we suffer an actual damage.

          <p>The right to request the deletion of your personal information</p>
          <p>
            You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal
            information, subject to exceptions set forth by the law (such as,
            including but not limited to, where the information is used to
            identify and repair errors on Nata in Data, to detect security

          <p>
            If no legal exception applies, as a result of exercising your right,

          <p>How to exercise your rights</p>
          <p>
            To exercise the rights described above, you need to submit your
            verifiable request to us by contacting us via the details provided
            in this document.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            For us to respond to your request, it&apos;s necessary that we know
            who you are. Therefore, you can only exercise the above rights by
            making a verifiable request which must:
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify
            you are the person about whom we collected personal information or
            an authorized representative;
          </p>
          <p>
            describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
            properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will not respond to any request if we are unable to verify your
            identity and therefore confirm the personal information in our
            possession actually relates to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            If you cannot personally submit a verifiable request, you can
            authorize a person registered with the California Secretary of State
            to act on your behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are an adult, you can make a verifiable request on behalf of
            a minor under your parental authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />

            You can submit a maximum number of 2 requests over a period of 12
            months.

          </p>
          <p>How and when we are expected to handle your request</p>

            and provide information about how we will process your request.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            We will respond to your request within 45 days of its receipt.
            Should we need more time, we will explain to you the reasons why,
            and how much more time we need. In this regard, please note that we
            may take up to 90 days to fulfill your request.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>Our disclosure(s) will cover the preceding 12 month period.</p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Should we deny your request, we will explain you the reasons behind
            our denial.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
            request unless such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. In
            such cases, we may charge a reasonable fee, or refuse to act on the
            request. In either case, we will communicate our choices and explain
            the reasons behind it.

          <p>We will strive to promptly respond to your requests.</p>
          <p>
            In any case, should it be impossible for us to do so, we&apos;ll
            make sure to communicate to you the factual or legal reasons that
            prevent us from immediately, or otherwise ever, complying with your
            requests. In cases where we are not processing your personal
            information, we will indicate to you the physical or legal person to
            whom you should address your requests, if we are in the position to
            do so.

          <p>
            In the event that you file an access or personal information
            processing confirmation request, please make sure that you specify
            whether you&apos;d like your personal information to be delivered in
            electronic or printed form.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will also need to let us know whether you want us to answer your
            request immediately, in which case we will answer in a simplified
            fashion, or if you need a complete disclosure instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the latter case, we&apos;ll respond within 15 days from the time
            of your request, providing you with all the information on the
            origin of your personal information, confirmation on whether or not
            records exist, any criteria used for the processing and the purposes
            of the processing, while safeguarding our commercial and industrial
            secrets.

            or personal information blocking request, we will make sure to
            immediately communicate your request to other parties with whom we
            have shared your personal information in order to enable such third
            parties to also comply with your request - except in cases where
            such communication is proven impossible or involves disproportionate
            effort on our side.
